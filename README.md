## :rocket: Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies listed on `package.json` file

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

> ## Considerations

I made an effort to create a simple solution that adheres to the given time constraints and application requirements, paying close attention to the CSS specifications provided by the template page.

To ensure code quality and proper commits, I implemented various packages such as eslint, husky, commitlint, and lint-staged. These tools helped maintain consistency and caught potential issues during development.

Additionally, I also used TDD to establish a testable architecture and minimize the need for extensive test mocking. This approach facilitated the construction process and ensured robust testing of critical components.

By combining these techniques and methodologies, I aimed to deliver a well-structured and thoroughly tested solution within the given constraints.



> ### Challenges

- Material UI
Over the past two years, my primary experience has been centered around utilizing a company-specific UI library. However, I have also explored Material UI during personal studies. 
Initially, I faced challenges in effectively leveraging its newer features. But I overcame these obstacles by diligently reading the documentation and conducting some researchs.


> ## ToDo

- Due to the available time and simplicity of the application, I chose not to implement a more complex architecture and end-to-end tests that could be done;
- Refactor the application using @mui/material since @material-ui/core is deprecated
- Upgrade packages to build using Node 18 or later since Node 16 is no longer a commercial version
